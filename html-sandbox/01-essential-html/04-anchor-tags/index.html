      Adam Optimizer (Adaptive Moment Estimation)
      <br>Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) is one of the most popular gradient-based optimization algorithms in deep learning. It combines the benefits of Momentum and RMSprop, making it well-suited for training deep neural networks efficiently.
      <br>Use Linear Regression for predicting continuous values (e.g., sales forecasting, temperature prediction).
      <br>Use Logistic Regression for classification tasks (e.g., fraud detection, medical diagnosis). 
      <h3>HTML Basics</h3>
      <ul>
        Now URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator and it includes protocols
      <br>And that response can include an HTML file. And that file is then rendered by the browser. you see the website. That HTML can include links to CSS files, JavaScript files, images and other assets.
      <br>HTTP is the communication language for client and server
      <br>Now, HTTP is stateless, which means that each request response cycle is independent from previous transactions.
	    <br>ex: When you refresh a web page, it's a completely different request than the last refresh and nothing carries over from the past request.
      <br>Cookies/Session helps to maintain some level of state for http
      <br>GET=> When you visit a website in a browser, it sends a get request to the server
      <br>POST=> when you're sending some data, typically through a web form.
      <br>PUT=> update, DELETE=>delete
      <br>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)=> Content & Structure
	    <br>It's the standard markup language for documents that are designed to be displayed in web browsers.
      <br>HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically. HTML  Elements tell the browser how to display the content
      <br>JavaScript=> Behavior of the website
      <br>JavaScript is a programming language, and it can be used to make your web pages dynamic and interactive.
      <br>Buttons/Pop ups/ sliders (JS+CSS)
      <br>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
      <br>It's a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of documents written in HTML.
      <br>HTML, CSS,JS client (Frontend) side technologies 
      <br>PHP, Python, NodeJS server (Backend) side technologies
      <br>IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment 
      </ul>

      <h3>Encapsulation (Access Modifiers)</h3>
  
      <br>Definition: Bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class), while restricting access to some of the object's components.
      <br>Goal: Hide internal implementation details and expose only what is necessary (via public methods).
      
      <h3>Inheritance</h3>
      <br>Definition: Inheritance allows a child class to inherit properties and behaviors from a parent class, promoting code reusability.
      <br>Goal: Reduces code duplication and improves maintainability.
      <h3>Abstraction</h3>
      <br>Definition: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.
      <br>Goal: Simplify the interface and make code more user-friendly.
    
      <h3>Polymorphism</h3>
      <br>Definition: Polymorphism allows one interface to have multiple implementations, enabling flexibility and dynamic method invocation.

      <br>Types:
      <br>Method Overriding (Runtime Polymorphism) – Child class provides a specific implementation of a method from the parent class.
      <br>Method Overloading (Compile-time Polymorphism) – Multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.
